imagiCharm code features

**Turn the pixel in the first row [0] and the second column [1] on:** 
```
m[0][1] = on
```

**Give the pixel a particular colour, e.g. red:**  
You can choose from: red (R), orange (O), yellow (Y), green (G), aqua (A), blue (B), purple (P), magenta (M), white (W) and black (K).  
This is how you assign the colour: 
```
m[0][1] = R
```
